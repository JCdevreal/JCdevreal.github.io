                    <b>Let's cut to the chase:</b> we will no longer continue offering Wave. We have shut down the software's services as of this announcement, and all user data has been deleted.

                <div>
                    As important as Wave was for the growth and credence of our company, it became clear that we must expand our horizons and move on. In light of this new direction, we have decided to sunset Wave and begin work on more ambitious projects. We are currently working on many very exciting things, which we hope to showcase soon. For now, you can learn more about our recent undertaking here:
